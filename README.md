The overall website is going to be a website of several hobbies that I have.
The idea is to create a website dedicated to multiple hobbies of mine. Each webpage will dedicate one hobby.

The index webpage will be an introduction to the website or the home page. 
Will include 
    - Basic info about me 
    - A list of all my hobbies 
    - Basic info about each one

Each webpage will  dedicate information to one specific hobby.
    - A table of...
        - The hobby
        - Description of the hobby (i guess) 
    - Images
    - Audio or Video 
        - Possibly Embedded

The nav bar will link each webpage as well as a contact form page to meet the assignment requirments.
